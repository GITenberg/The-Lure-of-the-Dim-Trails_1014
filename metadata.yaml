description: Take a trip along the dusty byways of the Old West in this book from
  renowned author B.M. Bowers. In The Lure of the Dim Trails, confirmed Yankee Bud
  Thurston sets off for points west to gather inspiration for his next novel. Will
  he blend in with the rough-and-tumble cowboys who populate the open range, or will
  he return empty-handed? Read this engrossing love letter to the Western landscape
  to find out.
